        Sale Your Partner is a fun and creative game where two players take turns
        presenting each other as if they were
        trying to sell them to a manager or a potential employer. The goal is to highlight
        the best qualities and skills
        of the partner in a humorous and persuasive manner.

    <h3>Here are the rules for playing the game:</h3>

    <ol class="game-rules">
        <li>
            <strong>Player roles:</strong>
            Each player takes turns being the "salesperson" and the "product."
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Introduction:</strong>
            The game starts with the first player introducing the second player as if they
            were meeting the manager for
            the first time. They can use fun and engaging descriptions to highlight the
            partner's personality.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Decoration:</strong>
            The first player then "decorates" the partner by complimenting their
            appearance, style, or any unique
            attributes they possess.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Hobbies:</strong>
            The first player continues by sharing the partner's hobbies or interests,
            emphasizing any relevant skills or
            talents.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Education:</strong>
            The first player talks about the partner's educational background, focusing on
            any achievements or areas of
            expertise.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How can he help:</strong>
            The first player concludes the presentation by describing how the partner can
            be a valuable asset to the
            manager's team or organization. They can highlight specific skills,
            qualifications, or experiences that would
            be beneficial.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Role reversal:</strong>
            The players switch roles, and the second player becomes the salesperson,
            presenting the first player in the
            same manner.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sales pitch:</strong>
            Each player should deliver their sales pitch with enthusiasm, creativity, and
            humor to make it more enjoyable.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Manager's response:</strong>
            After both players have presented each other, they can role-play the manager's
            reactions, responding with
            humor and feedback.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Winner:</strong>
            The winner is determined based on the manager's response or can be decided
            jointly based on the creativity
            and entertainment value of the presentations.
